# Customer-Lifetime-value-prediction
<h2>Description</h2>
Customer lifetime value (CLTV) is the total revenue a single customer can be estimated to make for a business throughout their business relationship. It's also possible to calculate CLTV just for a given time interval to gain  insights for a shorter term or quarterly/ annual business performance and prediction.
This project will help businesses in predicting Customer Lifetime value to segment customers and identify features of highly valuable customers to help businesses leverage insights to make cost-effective decisions,  allocate funds and implement strategies for marketing, customer acquisition, and profitability on products.
The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle, provided by Brazillian E-commerce company called Olist.

<h2>Terminology Alert!</h2>

- <b>Purchase Frequency</b> - is determined by calculating the proportion of the total number of orders placed by customers against the total number of customers.
- <b>Churn Rate</b> - It denotes the percentage of customers who have discontinued their association with the business.
